## Introduction

In *Dress to Impress*, players compete by showcasing their fashion sense. The game requires quick thinking and a good understanding of themes. Our auto-dress script simplifies this process, allowing players to focus on strategy rather than outfit selection.

## Features

- **Automatic Outfit Selection**: The script selects outfits based on the current theme, ensuring that players always look their best.
- **Speed**: Quickly equips outfits without manual input, allowing players to focus on the competition.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to set up and use, even for those new to scripting.
- **Competitive Edge**: Gain an advantage over other players by always being perfectly dressed.

## How It Works

The auto-dress script utilizes a simple algorithm to determine the best outfits based on the runway theme. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Theme Recognition**: The script identifies the current theme of the runway.
2. **Inventory Analysis**: It scans the player's inventory for suitable outfits.
3. **Outfit Selection**: Based on the theme and available outfits, the script selects the best options.
4. **Equipping Outfits**: Finally, the script equips the selected outfits seamlessly.

This automated process allows players to react quickly to changing themes, giving them a significant advantage in competitions.
